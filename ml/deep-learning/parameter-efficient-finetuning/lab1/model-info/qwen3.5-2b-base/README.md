> [!Note]
> This repository contains model weights and configuration files for the pre-trained only model in the Hugging Face Transformers format.

> These artifacts are compatible with Hugging Face Transformers, vLLM, SGLang, etc.
> 
> The intended use cases are fine-tuning, in-context learning experiments, and other research or development purposes, not direct interaction.
> However, the control tokens, e.g., `<|im_start|>` and `<|im_end|>` were trained to allow efficient LoRA-style PEFT with the official chat template, mitigating the need to finetune embeddings, a significant optimization given Qwen3.5's larger vocabulary.


Over recent months, we have intensified our focus on developing foundation models that deliver exceptional utility and performance. Qwen3.5 represents a significant leap forward, integrating breakthroughs in multimodal learning, architectural efficiency, reinforcement learning scale, and global accessibility to empower developers and enterprises with unprecedented capability and efficiency.

## Qwen3.5 Highlights

Qwen3.5 features the following enhancement:

- **Unified Vision-Language Foundation**: Early fusion training on multimodal tokens achieves cross-generational parity with Qwen3 and outperforms Qwen3-VL models across reasoning, coding, agents, and visual understanding benchmarks.

- **Efficient Hybrid Architecture**: Gated Delta Networks combined with sparse Mixture-of-Experts deliver high-throughput inference with minimal latency and cost overhead.

- **Scalable RL Generalization**: Reinforcement learning scaled across million-agent environments with progressively complex task distributions for robust real-world adaptability.

- **Global Linguistic Coverage**: Expanded support to 201 languages and dialects, enabling inclusive, worldwide deployment with nuanced cultural and regional understanding.

- **Next-Generation Training Infrastructure**: Near-100% multimodal training efficiency compared to text-only training and asynchronous RL frameworks supporting massive-scale agent scaffolds and environment orchestration.
